            <!--Major, Hobbies, music tast, Life event/history-->
            <p class="aboutme">Hello! I am a software engineer major with an emphasis in software design. I also plan on minoring in choral music and German. I'm from Saratoga Springs Utah. A little background about me in high school I was in my schools chamber choir and acapella, I loved it so much that I want to continue singing. My Opa (grandpa) is from Rosenheim, Bavaria. Bavaria is a state in Germany and Rosenheim is in the south of Bavaria. I also am a HUGE history buff, WW2 is probably my favorite time period, my great grandpa on my mom's side served in the Canadian army and my great grandfather on my dad's side (the German side) served in the luftwaffa. Feel free to ask me anymore questions about my family! I love to share my history. Another one of my passions is space, I love learning anything I can about it. My favorite type of music includes Alt Rock, Classical, and 40s-60s music.</p>
            <!--Work history and computer exp-->
            <p class="workhistory">Enough about my personal life, I've been working with computers sense 2014-2015. I started by building my own desktop then moved to building my friends PCs. I eventually found my way to Best Buy and worked as a computer sales advisor and geek squad agent. There I learned how to trouble shoot computers and fix most issues. I also learned how to google my problems and find the solutions. If you have any questions for me feel free to ask! I am an open book!</p>
